# Real-Estate-Case-Study

The aim of this data science project was to analyze monthly mortgage records of various families based on their geographic location. The project involved collecting data on monthly family income and real estate rental value, and using this information to identify potential monthly expenses across different regions.

To achieve this, I conducted a detailed data analysis and utilized a range of data science techniques. I developed a linear regression model to predict total monthly expenditure for home mortgage loans at both national and state levels. This provided me valuable insights into mortgage expenditure patterns and identifed key trends and patterns in the data.

In addition, I designed an interactive dashboard using Tableau to showcase key metrics and provide an easy-to-use interface for users to explore the data. The dashboard included a range of metrics, such as the number of loans, average rental income, monthly mortgage and owner's cost, and family income vs. mortgage cost comparison for different regions. This allowed users to quickly and easily visualize the data and gain a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns in the data.

Overall, this data science project was highly successful in achieving its objectives. The insights and analysis provided by the project can be used by policymakers, mortgage lenders, and individuals to make more informed decisions about their mortgage expenditure and financial planning. The interactive dashboard provides a powerful tool for exploring the data and gaining valuable insights into mortgage expenditure patterns across different regions.
